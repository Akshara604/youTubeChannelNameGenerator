Very simple project using python.\n
It takes in two inputs from the user, using the 'input' function.\n
First being the category of the user's youtube channel.\n
Second the name of the user's videogame avatar.\n
Finally it prints the YouTube channel name combining the second and the first inputs respectively, using the 'print' function.
